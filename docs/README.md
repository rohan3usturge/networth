## System Topology

# Assumptions

1. if currency call fails, networth calculation should not be carried forwarded.
2. Monthly payment is applicable only for assets. In general, assets and liabilities are inherently of different structure.
3. Choice of technology is influenced by current tech stack of Intuit citing possibility of lot of reuse of react and spring/java components.
4. The application would grow big in future and would require flexibility in terms of multiple SPAs instead of one SPA with multiple pages
5. We want the flexibility of CSR and SSR both.
6. Authentication will be plugged in based on a federated service.
